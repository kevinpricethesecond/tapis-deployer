# Actors (Abaco)

These are the Actors/Abaco daemons. You'll no doubt want to run some compute nodes elsewhere. Run this to get the ports where you'll want to point the compute nodes:

    $ ./getports 
    rabbit
    172.16.120.9:32759
    mongo
    172.16.120.9:31400
    nginx
    172.16.120.9:31015
